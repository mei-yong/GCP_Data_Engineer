Identity & Access Management

https://cloud.google.com/docs/enterprise/best-practices-for-enterprise-organizations
Q: Your organization develops and tests multiple applications on Compute Engine virtual machine instances across 3 environments; Test, Staging, and Production. The separate development teams for each application require minimal access to Production but broad access in Test and Staging. You need to design the Resource Manager structure to support your organization in following least-privilege best practices. What should you do?
A: Create one project per environment per application. Group each application team member into a Google Group. Assign the application teamâ€™s Google Group an Identity Access Management role at the project level. Because a project provides good isolation for each application team and managing membership via a group is easier to maintain over time


Encryption
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/

Customer Supplied Keys
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-supplied-keys
Not stored on Google servers
Includes TLS/HTTPS check - so that your key won't be intercepted midflight
Not supported by Storage Transfer Service, Dataflow, Dataproc, download objects
Encryption on individual objects, not on buckets
If you are performing a compose operation on objects encrypted by customer-supplied encryption keys, the component objects must be encrypted by the same key, and you need to provide the key with the compose request. The resulting composite object is encrypted by the same key.

Customer Managed Keys
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-managed-keys
Keys generated by Key Management Service
Stored within KMS
Not supported by Cloud SQL -> GCS, Dataflow
You can have a bucket encrypted using customer managed keys but pick particular objects in the bucket to encrypt using customer supplied keys
