Monitoring Agent
The Stackdriver Monitoring agent is a collectd-based daemon that gathers system and application metrics from virtual machine instances and sends them to Monitoring. By default, the Monitoring agent collects disk, CPU, network, and process metrics. Configuring the Monitoring agent allows third-party applications to get the full list of agent metrics. 

Logging Agent
The Stackdriver Logging agent streams logs from your VM instances and from selected third-party software packages to Stackdriver Logging. It is a best practice to run the Stackdriver Logging agent on all your VM instances.

# Install Stackdriver monitoring agent on VM
curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/install-monitoring-agent.sh
sudo bash install-monitoring-agent.sh

# Install Stackdriver logging agent on VM
curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/install-logging-agent.sh
sudo bash install-logging-agent.sh

Export logs & setting up sinks based on your filters
https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/
https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/aggregated_exports
GCS - storage
BQ - data analysis
PubSub topics - to pass to wherever else
The default sink only has logs from a particular resource (e.g. the one VM) so you need to set the sink's includeChildren=True

Reference: Stackdriver for GKE
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/kubernetes-engine/
GKE clusters have Stackdriver already on it by default
In the summary pane, you can view a cluster's key metrics, such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, and the number of open incidents.
You can view clusters by their infrastructure, workloads, or services.
You can inspect namespaces, nodes, workloads, services, pods, and containers.
For pods and containers, you can view metrics as a function of time and view log entries using the Logs Viewer.

Reference: Stackdriver for BQ
https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/auditlogs/
https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/monitoring#slots-available
Specifies things like a wildcard query only generates one TableDataRead entry instead of one for each table, etc
You can track and visualise BQ slot usage
