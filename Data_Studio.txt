Data Studio
* Visualisation dashboard connected to BQ

Access to the dashboards is not restricted but only users with the correct IAM permissions to the underlying BQ dataset can actually see the data dashboards

Caching
Query cache (cannot be disabled) - similar to BQ caching, if the dashboard you request requires running the same BQ query you've run before, Data Studio pulls from cache rather than querying BQ again
Prefetch cache (can be disabled) - aka smart cache. it tries to predict what your next query will be and will fetch the required data before you actually perform a query to speed up performance
