Rows are sorted lexicographically by row key - so if your key includes a timestamp, reverse it so that the latest entries appear at the top of the list
All operations are atomic at the row level - so avoid designs that require atomicity across rows - if you need to make atomic updates or reads to an entity, try to keep all information for an entity in a single row
It's better to have a few large tables than many small tables
Store a maximum of 10 MB in a single cell and 100 MB in a single row
For most use cases that involve logging/streaming data/timeseries data, a reasonable key would be 'entityid-reversedtimestamp'
