Reference: Regions & Zones
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/
It's good to put bunches of resources in different regions so that if one of them fails, others are still ok
Every resource in Compute Engine must be uniquely named across the project no matter if they're in different regions/zones

Zonal
VM instance <--> Persistent disk
VM instance <--> Static IP address

Regional
Static external IP addresses

Global resources
Addresses - static external IP addresses
Images (these can be shared across projects)
Snapshots - Persistent disk snapshots (these can be shared across projects)
VM instance templates (can be restricted to zones)
Cloud Interconnects - a highly available connection from your on-premises network to Google's network. interconnect attachments, which run inside of this connection, are regional resources.
VPC network - individual subnets are regional
Firewalls
Routes - manage how traffic is routed for a specific IP range
Global operations




Backing up using snapshots
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/restore-and-delete-snapshots
Existing VM disk -> create snapshot -> create VM instance boot disk -> create a new persistent disk when required
Snapshots only hold information about changes to the VM instance (kind of like Git versions) so when you delete old snapshots, information that the subsequent snapshots need to create a boot disk gets transfered to the next latest snapshot


Managed Instances Groups
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/creating-groups-of-managed-instances#monitoring_groups
Good for stateless apps - i.e. apps that don't need specific state of underlying VM instances to run
Identical instances based on an instance template - specify a container image or a custom image
Autohealing, load balancing, autoscaling, auto-updating
Single-zone or multi-zone in a region
Max 1000 VMs
When updating, max 1000 intances can be specified in a single request
