Backing up using snapshots
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/restore-and-delete-snapshots
Existing VM disk -> create snapshot -> create VM instance boot disk -> create a new persistent disk when required
Snapshots only hold information about changes to the VM instance (kind of like Git versions) so when you delete old snapshots, information that the subsequent snapshots need to create a boot disk gets transfered to the next latest snapshot
