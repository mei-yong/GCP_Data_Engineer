Backing up using snapshots
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/restore-and-delete-snapshots
Existing VM disk -> create snapshot -> create VM instance boot disk -> create a new persistent disk when required
Snapshots only hold information about changes to the VM instance (kind of like Git versions) so when you delete old snapshots, information that the subsequent snapshots need to create a boot disk gets transfered to the next latest snapshot

Managed Instances Groups
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/creating-groups-of-managed-instances#monitoring_groups
Good for stateless apps - i.e. apps that don't need specific state of underlying VM instances to run
Identical instances based on an instance template - specify a container image or a custom image
Autohealing, load balancing, autoscaling, auto-updating
Single-zone or multi-zone in a region
Max 1000 VMs
When updating, max 1000 intances can be specified in a single request
